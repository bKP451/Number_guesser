# Number_guesser
This non-GUI program is developed using python.

# Workflow

First, user is prompted to enter the level he wants to play the game. 
There are two levels:
 i. Easy Level - 10 lives are available to the user to guess the number
 ii. Hard Level - 5 lives are available to the user to guess the number

As a hint, User is shown too high or too low, so he can re-think the number and try again until his lives is available.
